Hey! Its me Axolotl, this is the first time I worked in C# and Unity, so a lot of this is gonna be messed up, overcomplicated or just weird solutions
Im gonna leave a few notes about my codes, I know I can leave them in the code itself but I keep either forgetting or just hate to overthink while coding
